<em>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general</em>
<strong> sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature,</strong>
 <big>human activity or humans as a whole are often described </big>as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]
<em>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.</em>
With the Industrial Revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as 


sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of nature
closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after <strong>Charles Darwin</strong>.

<h3>Etymology</h3>
<hr>
<div>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".
<b>In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals<b>, 
<i>and other features of the world to develop of their own accord.The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[2] it<i>
 began with certain <br>
 <small>core applications of the</small><br>
 word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers<br>(though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since. <br>
